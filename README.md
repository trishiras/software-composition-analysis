# software-composition-analysis


## Overview
The Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool is designed to help developers and security teams identify and manage open-source components and third-party libraries within their software projects. It analyzes the dependencies of your codebase, detects known vulnerabilities, and assesses compliance with license obligations. By providing visibility into the composition of your software, the SCA tool helps mitigate security risks and ensures adherence to open-source policies.


## Key Features
    - Dependency Scanning: Automatically detects open-source components, libraries, and their versions 
    used in the project.
    - Vulnerability Detection: Identifies known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the project's dependencies 
    by cross-referencing with public databases like the NVD (National Vulnerability Database).
    - License Compliance: Analyzes the licenses of third-party components to ensure compliance 
    with your organization's policies.
    - Detailed Reports: Generates comprehensive reports on identified vulnerabilities, licenses, 
    and remediation steps.
    - Continuous Monitoring: Supports ongoing monitoring of dependencies for newly disclosed vulnerabilities.
